# Concurrency control: Ensures only one deployment runs at a time
# - group: Logical grouping for this workflow (same across all project types)
# - cancel-in-progress: Cancels any currently running deployment before starting a new one
# This prevents multiple deployments from stacking up or conflicting if you push rapidly

          # Cache: Speed up dependency installation by caching pnpm's store directory
          # On subsequent runs, pnpm reuses cached dependencies instead of re-downloading them

      # Install dependencies for the project
      # --no-frozen-lockfile: Allows pnpm to update the lock file if needed
      #   By default, pnpm is strict and fails if pnpm-lock.yaml is missing or outdated
      #   This flag lets pnpm regenerate the lock file, useful if it's not committed or is stale
      #   Tradeoff: Less reproducible (lock file may differ between runs), but more flexible
      # Note: For production, consider using --frozen-lockfile for strict reproducibility
